# ALA_Datalink

ALA_DataLink a research project for a software Reference Architecture called Abstraction Layered Architecture (ALA) (http://www.abstractionlayeredarchitecture.com).

It is a joint project by a master student Rosman (Xingbin) Cheng, John Spray of Datamars and Roopak Sinha of AUT.

The project is a rewrite of a Datamars owned Windows desktop application called DataLink that provides inter-communication between Datamar's many devices, the user, disk files and various cloud destinations. It potentially has commercial value for Datamars if it proves to significantly reduce maintenance effort over the existing Datalink application. It is also hoped that it will enabale business logic code sharing across to MacOS desktop, Android and IOS mobiles. 

Abstraction Layered Architecture is theretically optimized for the maintainabilty quality attribute, and the research aims to measure if this is true in paractice. If the new application becomes commercial, there will be on-going opportunity to compare the maintanabilty between the old and new.

## Getting Started

The application is initially written in C# and uses Visual Studio 2019. Swift (iOS and MacOS) and Java (Andriod) version to follow.
